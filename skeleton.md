What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px?
The columns begin to stack one on top of the other. Each Column will expand to
cover the entire row's width.
How do you think that works?
Because the layout has a max width of 960 px that can shrink with any browser
or device that is a smaller size.
